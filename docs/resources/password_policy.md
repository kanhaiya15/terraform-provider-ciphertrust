# ciphertrust_password_policy (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform Configuration for CipherTrust Provider

# This configuration demonstrates the creation of a Password Policy resource
# with the CipherTrust provider, including setting up password policy details.

terraform {
  # Define the required providers for the configuration
  required_providers {
    # CipherTrust provider for managing CipherTrust resources
    ciphertrust = {
      # The source of the provider
      source = "ThalesGroup/CipherTrust"
      # Version of the provider to use
      version = "1.0.0-pre3"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the CipherTrust provider for authentication
provider "ciphertrust" {
	# The address of the CipherTrust appliance (replace with the actual address)
  address = "https://10.10.10.10"

  # Username for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  username = "admin"

  # Password for authenticating with the CipherTrust appliance
  password = "ChangeMe101!"
}

# Global Password Policy
resource "ciphertrust_password_policy" "GlobalPasswordPolicy"{
    # No policy_name means policy is global
    inclusive_min_upper_case = 2
    inclusive_min_lower_case = 2
    inclusive_min_digits = 2
    inclusive_min_other = 2
    inclusive_min_total_length = 10
    inclusive_max_total_length = 50
    password_history_threshold = 10
    failed_logins_lockout_thresholds = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    password_lifetime = 20
    password_change_min_days = 100
}

# Custom Password Policy
resource "ciphertrust_password_policy" "CustomPasswordPolicy"{
    # Name of the password policy to be updated
    policy_name = "testcustompolicyname"
    inclusive_min_upper_case = 2

    inclusive_min_other = 2

    password_history_threshold = 10
    failed_logins_lockout_thresholds = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    password_lifetime = 20
    password_change_min_days = 100
}

# Output the unique ID of the global password policy
output "global_pwd_policy_id" {
    value = ciphertrust_password_policy.GlobalPasswordPolicy.id
}

# Output the unique ID of the custom password policy
output "custom_pwd_policy_id" {
    value = ciphertrust_password_policy.CustomPasswordPolicy.id
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `failed_logins_lockout_thresholds` (List of Number) List of lockout durations in minutes for failed login attempts. For example, with input of [0, 5, 30], the first failed login attempt with duration of zero will not lockout the user account, the second failed login attempt will lockout the account for 5 minutes, the third and subsequent failed login attempts will lockout for 30 minutes. Set an empty array '[]' to disable the user account lockout.List of lockout durations in minutes for failed login attempts.
